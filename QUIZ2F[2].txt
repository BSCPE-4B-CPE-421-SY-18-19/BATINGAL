Observation:
	The fuse of the power supply was defective. The result in it was
	failure to the system. It results for us to fail to check the other
	parts especially the motherboard. The CPU fan is functional but we 
	observerd that the system unit is dusty and the cables are old enough
	to break at anytime.
Solutions:
	> Buy new fuse of the power supply.
	> Buy new power supply.
	> Buy a new set of System Unit.

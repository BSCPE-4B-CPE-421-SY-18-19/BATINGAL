Question: Why does the Raspberry Pi functioning?
Answer: The Raspberry Pi is functioning because there is an OS installed, and 
	the connecting wires are in good condition, that makes the Raspberry
	Pi functions.The charger used was properly connected to the ports of
	Raspberry Pi. And it is good that the charger is functioning too.Also
	the Raspberry Pi is in good condition. The red light and the green light
	is functioning too. The red light indicates the power supply is functioning
	and the green light is for the OS installed.
	This answer is according to Neil Cotacte because they've tried troubleshooting
	the Raspberry Pi. And also, according to Christian Lloyd Salon because he 
	did a troubleshooting on his Raspberry Pi. The site he searched was,
	elinux.org/R-Pi-troubleshooting.
